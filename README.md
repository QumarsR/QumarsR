### Hey there, I'm Qumars 👋

Based out of Toronto, I rock the world as a Senior Developer and Cloud Architect. Originally a self-taught coder, I got hooked on the magic of programming. Though, as it merged with my daily job, the spark kind of dimmed, turning more into a grind than a passion. I'm on a mission to recapture that love for coding, now looking at life's puzzles as exciting challenges to tackle.
